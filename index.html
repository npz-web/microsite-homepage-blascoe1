            <p class="text1"> Baseball has been part of American history for well over 150 years now. 
                Baseball is an American family tradition and has been considered to be America's pastime for generations. 
                From the Civil War to Civil Rights and all points in between and beyond, the game of baseball supports 
                and reflects many aspects of American life, from culture to economics and technological advances.

             The sport dates back as far as 1744 and formats of the game have been in place until
              the modern era today. Baseball is predominantly big in North America, Canada and Japan. The game is 
              played worldwide with the pinnacle of sport coming from the World Series of Baseball, which ironically is 
              only competed by North American teams.
