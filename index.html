            <p> Baseball has been part of American history for well over 150 years now. Baseball is an American family tradition and has been considered to be America's pastime for generations. From the Civil War to Civil Rights and all points in between and beyond, the game of baseball supports and reflects many aspects of American life, from culture to economics and technological advances. It inspires movements, instills pride and even heals cities.
