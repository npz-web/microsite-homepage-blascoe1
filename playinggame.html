            <p> 
                The object of baseball is to score more runs than your opponent. The idea is to hit the ball thrown at you as far as you 
                can before running around 4 bases to complete a run. Once a player manages to get around the four bases before being tagged out, 
                then another batter steps in.
            </p>
        </div>

        <br>

        <p class="play2">
            A game is played out between two teams, each made up of 9 players. The game lasts for 9 innings with each team alternating between 
           batting and fielding in each inning. The scores at the end of the innings are added to a cumulative score and the team with most points 
           wins. Each team has three outs per inning before they then swap roles. Each inning can be broken down into the top (where the away team bats), 
           and the bottom (where the home team bats).

             The field is split into two sections: infield and outfield. Separating the infield and outfield is a diamond shape with four bases, spaced 
             at 90 feet apart each. In the center of the infield is the pitching mound where the pitcher stands and throws the ball toward the batter. 
             The batter stands at the home plate. The other three bases are known as first base, second base and third base. The batter must touch all bases 
             before successfully scoring a run.

        <h3 class="playhead1"> Scoring </h3>

        <p class="play4">
            To score, a batter must hit the ball with the bat into the designated fielding area and make it around all four bases (before the fielding 
            team is able to collect the ball and throw it to the base the batter is running to). A player can score a mandatory point if they hit a home run,
             which usually means the ball has left the playing area, often landing in the crowd. A player can stop at any base if they feel they might not make 
             it to the next base before being tagged out.
        </p>

        <br>
        <br>

        <h3 class="playhead1"> Winning </h3>

        <p class="play5">
            To win a game, you must outscore your opposition through the 9 innings played. The team with the most points after 9 innings is deemed the winner. 
            In the event of a tie, extra innings are played until a winner has been concluded.

        <div class="position">
            <h1 class="playhead2"> Pitcher </h1>

            <p class="play6">
             This player stands on a rubber plate in the middle of the pitcher’s mound, a round space in the center of the baseball diamond. 
             From here, the pitcher throws the ball toward home plate, where a batter from the opposing team is in a ready stance, hoping to hit the pitch.
             There are several types of pitches the pitcher can throw, goal, in general, is to achieve an out against the batter. 
             <br>
             <br>
             Pitchers can do this in a number of ways, including:
                <br>
                <br>
             Striking out the batter (a strike occurs when a batter swings and misses the ball, fails to swing at the ball when it crosses through the strike zone or hits a foul ball). After three strikers, the batter is out.
             <br>
             <br>
             Throwing a pitch that is hit by the batter and then caught (or fielded successfully) by a fellow defending player.

            </p>

        <br>
        <br>

        <div class="position">
            <h1 class="playhead2"> Catcher </h1>

            <p class="play6">
                The catcher’s most essential job is to catch pitches. This player, decked out in protective padding and a mask, 
                crouches behind home plate in front of the umpire. The catcher holds up a large, round glove — called a catcher’s 
                mitt — to give the pitcher a target to throw his pitch toward. And if the batter doesn’t hit the ball, it’s the 
                catcher’s job to catch it.

                <br>
                <br>
                
                Catchers have a long list of responsibilities that make them the leaders of the infield. Catchers must: call pitches, block wild pitches,
                direct the infield when the ball is in play, throw out runners who are trying to steal, and cover home plate. 



            </p>
        </div>

        <br>
        <br>
        <br>

        <div class="position">
            <h1 class="playhead2"> First Base </h1>

            <p class="play6">
               
                The first baseman protects first base. If a ball is hit in the first baseman’s direction, they must field the ball and try to 
                get the opposing player out.

                <br>
                <br>

                When a ground ball is hit to an infielder besides the first baseman and no runners are on first base, that infielder will throw the ball 
                to the first baseman, who must catch it with at least one foot touching first base in order to get the batter out.



            </p>
        </div>

        <br>
        <br>
        <br>

        <div class="position">
            <h1 class="playhead2"> Second Base </h1>

            <p class="play6">
                
                Unlike the first and third basemen, who stand right next to the bases they’re assigned, second basemen usually stand in the area between 
                first and second base. That’s because ground balls are hit there more often than directly up the middle of the field. Together, the second
                 baseman and shortstop (more on this below) are called the “middle infield.”

                <br>
                <br>

                Second basemen field ground balls and fly balls in their designated area, as well as playing a key part in ditinct defensive plays. 
                
            </p>
        </div>

        <br>
        <br>
        <br>

        <div class="position">
            <h1 class="playhead2"> Shortstop </h1>

            <p class="play6">
                The shortstop’s usual position is between second and third base. This position has a lot of the field to cover and must make throws 
                and catches while running hard, which requires lots of skill.

                <br>
                <br>

                Shortstops have to run to field slow-rolling balls, quickly move left to snag balls that have been smashed up the middle of the field and be
                 able to execute double plays. The shortstop also needs to cover second base on stolen-base attempts.
            </p>
        </div>

        <br>
        <br>
        <br>

        <div class="position">
            <h1 class="playhead2"> Third Base </h1>

            <p class="play6">
                When a right-handed hitter takes a hard swing and is in front of a pitch, he’ll “pull” the ball, hitting it to the left side of the field. 
                If that ball is hit on the ground or as a line drive, it hurtles toward the third baseman at high speeds.
                <br>
                <br>
                Players at this position need to be ready for balls that come off the bat like a rocket, but they also need to be close enough to home plate to 
                run up and field short grounders
            </p>
        </div>

        <br>
        <br>
        <br>

        <div class="position">
            <h1 class="playhead2"> Outfield:
                <br> 
                Right, Center, & Left Field
            </h1>

            <p class="play6">

                The right fielder stands in right field — in the grass area of the outfield between the right-field foul line and the center of the outfield. 
                The right fielder is responsible for catching fly balls, fielding ground balls and throwing the ball into the infield. 
                The throw from deep right field to third base is one of the longest possible tosses in baseball, so right fielders traditionally have strong throwing arms.

                <br>
                <br>

                The center fielder plays in the outfield — the area of grass beyond the dirt infield — and is also responsible for catching 
                fly balls, fielding ground balls and throwing balls to the infielders. Center fielders have a huge amount of ground to cover, 
                so they’re often fast players, and they’re generally skilled at catching.

                <br>
                <br>

                Left fielders patrol the area of the outfield from the left-field foul line to the center of the outfield, between second and third base. 
                Their job is similar to that of the other outfielders — run after fly balls and ground balls hit into their area.
