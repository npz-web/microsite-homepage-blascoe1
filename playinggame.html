                The object of baseball is to score more runs than your opponent. The idea is to hit the ball thrown at you as far as you 
                can before running around 4 bases to complete a run. Once a player manages to get around the four bases before being tagged out, 
                then another batter steps in.

                 A game is played out between two teams, each made up of 9 players. The game lasts for 9 innings with each team alternating between 
                batting and fielding in each inning. The scores at the end of the innings are added to a cumulative score and the team with most points 
                wins. Each team has three outs per inning before they then swap roles. Each inning can be broken down into the top (where the away team bats), 
                and the bottom (where the home team bats).

            The field is split into two sections: infield and outfield. Separating the infield and outfield is a diamond shape with four bases, spaced 
            at 90 feet apart each. In the center of the infield is the pitching mound where the pitcher stands and throws the ball toward the batter. 
            The batter stands at the home plate. The other three bases are known as first base, second base and third base. The batter must touch all bases 
            before successfully scoring a run.

        </p>

        <h3 class="playhead"> Scoring </h3>

        <p class="play3">
            To score, a batter must hit the ball with the bat into the designated fielding area and make it around all four bases (before the fielding 
            team is able to collect the ball and throw it to the base the batter is running to). A player can score a mandatory point if they hit a home run,
             which usually means the ball has left the playing area, often landing in the crowd. A player can stop at any base if they feel they might not make 
             it to the next base before being tagged out.
        </p>

        <h3 class="playhead"> Winning </h3>

        <p class="play4">
            To win a game, you must outscore your opposition through the 9 innings played. The team with the most points after 9 innings is deemed the winner. 
            In the event of a tie, extra innings are played until a winner has been concluded.
