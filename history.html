                <h2> Babe's Called Shot
                  <br>
                  Oct. 1, 1932 </h2>
                <p class="story1">

                  It was the New York Yankees vs. the Chicago Cubs,  Game 3 of the 1932 Fall Classic.
                  <br>
                  <br>
                  During the fifth inning of the game at Wrigley Field, Babe Ruth was at the plate facing pitcher Charlie Root. Ruth, amid heckling and 
                  taunts from the Cubs players and fans, pointed towards the outfield,
                  either gesturing or verbally calling his shot, indicating that he would hit a home run to that exact spot. 
                  On the next pitch, Ruth slammed a home run to deep center field. As he rounded the bases, it appeared that he pointed to the outfield, 
                  possibly reinforcing the claim that he had indeed called his shot. 
                  <br>
                  <br>
                  However, there's controversy surrounding this moment, with some 
                  witnesses and even Ruth himself downplaying the gesture, stating that Ruth was merely responding to the taunting from the Cubs' bench, 
                  rather than specifically calling his shot. 
                  <br>
                  <br>
                  Regardless of the exact truth, the "called shot" has become a part of baseball folklore, 
                  symbolizing Ruth's confidence and larger-than-life persona. It remains a debated and celebrated moment in baseball history, contributing 
                  to the mystique surrounding one of the game's greatest players. </p>
