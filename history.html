                <h2> The Luckiest Man Alive
                  <br>
                  1939 </h2>
                <p>

                  Lou Gehrig, famed for his 2,130 consecutive-games-played streak, made one of the most memorable speeches 
                  in the annals of sports. It was on July 4, 1939, now Lou Gehrig Appreciation Day, when the longtime Yankee 
                  first baseman uttered the famous words at a home plate ceremony at Yankee Stadium: “For the past two weeks you
                  have been reading about a bad break. Yet today I consider myself the luckiest man on the face of the earth.”
                  <br>
                  <br>
                  Gehrig had been forced to retire as a player two weeks earlier due to his being diagnosed with amyotrophic 
                  lateral sclerosis, the disease that today bears his name. Gehrig died at the age of 37 on June 2, 1941, but 
                  he lives on through his legacy as "the Iron Horse" of baseball.

                <p> 
                  Known as the Curse of the Billy Goat after an incident 
              in 1945 when Billy Goat Tavern owner William Sianis was asked to leave the stadium after his pet goat, named 
              Murphy, was bothering other fans. Outraged, Sianis allegedly declared, "Them Cubs, they ain't gonna win no more".
              <br>
              <br>
             The supposed curse lasted 71 years, from 1945 to the Cubs 2016 championship season. In 2016, the Cubs, led by a 
             talented roster that included Kris Bryant, Anthony Rizzo, and Jake Arrieta, battled their way through the playoffs
              and found themselves facing off against the Cleveland Indians in the World Series. After the incident with Sianis 
              and Murphy, the supposed curse lasted 71 years, from 1945 to the Cubs 2016 Championship season. 
              <br>
              <br>
              On the 46th anniversary of William Sianis' death, the "curse" was broken when they defeated the Los Angeles 
              Dodgers 5–0 in Game 6 of the 2016 National League Championship Series to win the NL pennant, and went on to secure the 2016 World Series 
              victory against the American League champion Cleveland Indians. 
              With a score of 8–7 in 10 innings in Game 7, they secured victory 108 years after their last win in 1908.
