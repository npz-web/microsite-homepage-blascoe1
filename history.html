                <h2> Babe's Called Shot
                  <br>
                  1932 </h2>
                <p class="story1">

                  It was Oct. 1, 1932, the New York Yankees vs. the Chicago Cubs in Game 3 of the 1932 Fall Classic.
                  <br>
                  <br>
                  During the fifth inning of the game at Wrigley Field, Babe Ruth was at the plate facing pitcher Charlie Root. Ruth, amid heckling and 
                  taunts from the Cubs players and fans, pointed towards the outfield,
                  either gesturing or verbally calling his shot, indicating that he would hit a home run to that exact spot. 
                  On the next pitch, Ruth slammed a home run to deep center field. As he rounded the bases, it appeared that he pointed to the outfield, 
                  possibly reinforcing the claim that he had indeed called his shot. 
                  <br>
                  <br>
                  However, there's controversy surrounding this moment, with some 
                  witnesses and even Ruth himself downplaying the gesture, stating that Ruth was merely responding to the taunting from the Cubs' bench, 
                  rather than specifically calling his shot. 
                  <br>
                  <br>
                  Regardless of the exact truth, the "called shot" has become a part of baseball folklore, 
                  symbolizing Ruth's confidence and larger-than-life persona. It remains a debated and celebrated moment in baseball history, contributing 
                  to the mystique surrounding one of the game's greatest players. </p>

                <h2> The Luckiest Man Alive
                  <br>
                  1939
                </h2>
                <p> Lou Gehrig, famed for his 2,130 consecutive-games-played streak, made one of the most memorable speeches 
                  in the annals of sports. It was on July 4, 1939, now Lou Gehrig Appreciation Day, when the longtime Yankee 
                  first baseman uttered the famous words at a home plate ceremony at Yankee Stadium: “For the past two weeks you
                  have been reading about a bad break. Yet today I consider myself the luckiest man on the face of the earth.”
                  <br>
                  <br>
                  Gehrig had been forced to retire as a player two weeks earlier due to his being diagnosed with amyotrophic 
                  lateral sclerosis, the disease that today bears his name. Gehrig died at the age of 37 on June 2, 1941, but 
                  he lives on through his legacy as "the Iron Horse" of baseball.

                <h2> The Rise of Jackie Robinson
                  <br>
                  1947 </h2>
                <p class="story2">
                  Jackie Robinson signed with the Brooklyn Dodgers on April 10th, 1947, and he was the first African American 
                    to play in a major league team, breaking the race barrier in baseball. He was praised for his athleticism 
                    on the field, being named Rookie of the Year in 1947 and getting inducted into the Baseball Hall of Fame in 
                    1962. 
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Robinson was the first professional athlete to have his jersey number, 42, retired across the sport. 
                    The number 42 is now worn by all baseball players in the league during games held on April 15th, the date of 
                    Robinson’s MLB debut, which is now known as Jackie Robinson Day.

                <h2> Cubs Break the Curse
                  <br>
                  2016</h2>
                <p >
                  The Chicago Cubs had not won a World Series since 1908. Known as the Curse of the Billy Goat after an incident 
                  in 1945 when Billy Goat Tavern owner William Sianis was asked to leave the stadium after his pet goat, named 
                  Murphy, was bothering other fans. Outraged, Sianis allegedly declared, "Them Cubs, they ain't gonna win no more".
                  <br>
                  <br>
                 The supposed curse lasted 71 years, from 1945 to the Cubs 2016 championship season. In 2016, the Cubs, led by a 
                 talented roster that included Kris Bryant, Anthony Rizzo, and Jake Arrieta, battled their way through the playoffs
                  and found themselves facing off against the Cleveland Indians in the World Series. After the incident with Sianis 
                  and Murphy, the supposed curse lasted 71 years, from 1945 to the Cubs 2016 Championship season. 
                  <br>
                  <br>
                  On the 46th anniversary of William Sianis' death, the "curse" was broken when they defeated the Los Angeles 
                  Dodgers 5–0 in Game 6 of the 2016 National League Championship Series to win the NL pennant. Later that season, 
                  the Cubs then  went on to secure the World Series victory against the American League champion Cleveland Indians. 
                  With a score of 8–7 in 10 innings in Game 7, they secured victory 108 years after their last win.
