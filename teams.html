                    The American League of Professional Baseball Clubs, known simply as the American League (AL), 
                    is one of two leagues that make up Major League Baseball. It developed from the Western League,
                    a minor league based in the Great Lakes states, which eventually aspired to major league status. 
                    It is sometimes called the Junior Circuit because it claimed Major League status for the 1901 season, 
                    25 years after the formation of the National League (the "Senior Circuit").

        <p class="pteams" id="teamsopener"> 
                    
            Minor League Baseball (MiLB) serves as a developmental league for Major League Baseball (MLB) teams. It consists of numerous 
            leagues and levels spread across the United States and Canada. The primary purpose of the minor leagues is to nurture young talent, 
            providing players opportunities to develop their skills before potentially advancing to the major leagues.

            <br>
            <br>

            MiLB is structured into various levels or classifications, often referred to as "farm teams" or affiliates, which align with MLB clubs. 
            These levels include Triple-A, Double-A, High-A, Single-A (often divided into two sub-levels: Advanced-A and Low-A), and Rookie leagues. 
            Players typically start their professional careers in Rookie or Single-A levels and progress upwards based on performance and potential.

            <br>
            <br>

            Each MLB team has affiliations with minor league clubs, where they send their prospects to gain experience and refine their skills. Minor 
            league teams serve as training grounds for players, coaches, and umpires, offering a competitive environment to prepare for the demands of 
            Major League Baseball.

        <h3 class="hteams"> Triple-A </h3>
           
          <p class="pteams"> 
    
            This classification currently includes two affiliated leagues: the 20-team International League and the 10-team Pacific Coast League. 
            Both young players and veterans play for Triple-A teams. Parent clubs often hold players who are on the 40-man roster, but not on the
             active MLB roster, at the Triple-A level. 
             <br>
             <br>
             Such players are eligible to be added to a team's active major league roster. For teams in 
             contention for a pennant late in a season, it gives them fresh players, while for teams not in contention, it gives them an opportunity to 
             evaluate their second-tier players against major league competition. Some Triple-A players are "career minor leaguers", former prospects
            whose skill growth has halted and who are not likely to advance to MLB, unless as a temporary replacement.

        <h3 class="hteams"> Double-A </h3>
           
          <p class="pteams"> 
    
            Double-A leagues, like the Eastern League, Southern League, Texas League, and others, serve as an intermediary level for aspiring players, 
            providing a competitive environment to further hone their skills. It's often seen as a pivotal point in a player's journey to the major leagues.
            The level of play in Double-A is notably higher than Single-A, with players facing more experienced opponents.
