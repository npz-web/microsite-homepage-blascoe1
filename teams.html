                    The American League of Professional Baseball Clubs, known simply as the American League (AL), 
                    is one of two leagues that make up Major League Baseball. It developed from the Western League,
                    a minor league based in the Great Lakes states, which eventually aspired to major league status. 
                    It is sometimes called the Junior Circuit because it claimed Major League status for the 1901 season, 
                    25 years after the formation of the National League (the "Senior Circuit").

        <p class="pteams" id="teamsopener"> 
                    
            Minor League Baseball (MiLB) serves as a developmental league for Major League Baseball (MLB) teams. It consists of numerous 
            leagues and levels spread across the United States and Canada. The primary purpose of the minor leagues is to nurture young talent, 
            providing players opportunities to develop their skills before potentially advancing to the major leagues.

            <br>
            <br>

            MiLB is structured into various levels or classifications, often referred to as "farm teams" or affiliates, which align with MLB clubs. 
            These levels include Triple-A, Double-A, High-A, Single-A (often divided into two sub-levels: Advanced-A and Low-A), and Rookie leagues. 
            Players typically start their professional careers in Rookie or Single-A levels and progress upwards based on performance and potential.

            <br>
            <br>

            Each MLB team has affiliations with minor league clubs, where they send their prospects to gain experience and refine their skills. Minor 
            league teams serve as training grounds for players, coaches, and umpires, offering a competitive environment to prepare for the demands of 
            Major League Baseball.

                game adaptation, and adjusting to the demands of the sport. Rookie leagues often focus on providing a supportive environment for young talent
